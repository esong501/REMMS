As a user, I want to see things to do in my area so that I can go and experience local hot spots.
I'll know when this is done whenâ€¦
- the app fetches my location,
- returns a list of things to do,
- the app categorizes activities to do in my area (e.g. Restaurants, theaters, parks, zoos, etc),
- and pins them on a map (think searching on Google Maps?)
